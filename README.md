I want to create an app that helps high school students explore educational and career paths based on their unique strengths, interests, and personality. The goal is to make planning for the future feel more approachable by providing personalized suggestions that truly reflect who they are. The app would feature a short quiz to build a user profile, then recommend relevant majors, career options, or skill building programs. It would also offer simulation projects like the one I am doing with CodePath to let students try things out firsthand. I would like to include a feature that connects users with college students for real life guidance. Accessibility is a priority as well, so the app would support visually impaired users, offer multiple language options, and have a clear and user friendly layout.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

One of the biggest challenges I faced while building the app was navigating Xcode and understanding how it works.When working with the layout felt confusing, especially when working with labels. It seemed oddly organized, and I found that just having my name, college name, and job title on the screen felt incomplete. I decided to add three more labels to provide more context and make the app feel more informative. Another challenge was learning how to connect a button from the storyboard to the logic in the ViewController.swift file. It took some trial and error, but once I understood the process, it became easier to implement other features.
